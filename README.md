Learning About Version Control

Wendy Frankel

Solving merge conflicts takes concious effort.

Edit your README.md so that you add at least one sentence about what you like most about version control, and add at least one sentence about what you find most challenging/confusing/frustrating about version control (we all have opinions on this one…). Add and commit your changes to local version control.

What I like most: very easy to collaborate with teammates, and see exactly what they've done

What I like the least: Dealing with merge conflicts where you dont understand what's happened.
